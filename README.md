- 👋 Hi, Toplus8 here!
- 👀 New to code tipping and the CSS magic.
- 🌱 Always learning, here you will find exercises so don't expect (public) great projects, anyway I am ready to give my best to develope and manage them well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects or just check the code work of other people to learn and follow the right path of the coding.
- 📫 How to reach me... give me a shout here!
